# Brief explanation of the program: This program takes voting data as input, including the number of candidates,
# their last names, and the number of votes received by each candidate. It then processes this data and displays
# various statistics, including the total number of votes, the average number of votes, and a list of candidates
# who received more votes than the average.

# Define a function to get a valid number input from the user within a given range.

    Function to get a valid number input from the user within a given range.

    lower_bound (int): The lower bound of the valid range.
    upper_bound (int): The upper bound of the valid range.

    Returns:
